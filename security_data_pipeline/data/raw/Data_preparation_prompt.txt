hello chat, i am building an AI chatbot that will be responsible for providing security details to it's users, by providing a detailed security breakdown of a given location provided by the user, these information should reflect off the data sets i will provide. For the mean time we would work with this datasets but later keep our data updated by connecting to API, i want you to analyze the various datasets I'll provide and clean, merge, prepare, delete unnecessary columns and finally immerge with a single data frame i can use for this project. due to the fact i can only upload 10 files at a time i will provide the other datasets in batches, when we are done we would have one data frame.
